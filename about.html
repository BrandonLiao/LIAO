       My name is Brandon, I'm from KunMing. Kunming is the capital of beautiful Yunnan Province located in the far southwestern corner of China. 
          It is well known as the "Spring City,"It is neither too hot in summer or too cold in winter. There are many famous local dishes, such as Crossing Bridge Noodles. A walk through the Bird and Flower Market, 
          the Yunnan University area, or around Green Lake Park is a great way to enjoy a sunny afternoon in Kunming.
